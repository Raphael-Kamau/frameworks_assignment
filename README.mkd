# CORD-19 Data Explorer

This project analyzes COVID-19 research metadata from the CORD-19 dataset and presents insights using a Streamlit dashboard.

## Features

- **Publication trends by year:** Visualizes how research output changed over time.
- **Top publishing journals:** Highlights the most active journals in the dataset.
- **Word cloud of frequent title terms:** Shows common keywords in paper titles.
- **Interactive filters and data preview:** Lets users explore and filter the data dynamically.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **Streamlit**: Builds the interactive web dashboard.
- **WordCloud**: Generates word clouds for text data.

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Data

- Uses the [CORD-19 dataset](https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19/download) (metadata CSV).
- **Note:** The dataset is large. Sampling may be required for performance.

## Example Insights

- Most papers were published in 2020 and 2021.
- Top journals include medRxiv and bioRxiv.
- Frequent title words: "COVID", "SARS", "pandemic".

## Challenges

- Large dataset required sampling for responsiveness.
- Many missing values in journal and abstract fields.
- Streamlit layout needed careful filtering to avoid slowdowns.

## Learnings

- Gained confidence in data cleaning and visualization.
- Built interactive dashboards with Streamlit.
- Understood the importance of preprocessing data for clarity.
